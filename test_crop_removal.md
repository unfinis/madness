# Crop Tool Removal Test

## Summary of Changes Made

✅ **Tool Button Preserved**: The crop tool button remains in the tool panel with its original:
- Icon: `Icons.crop`
- Display name: "Crop"
- Keyboard shortcut: "C"
- Position in Selection Tools group

✅ **Functionality Disabled**: All crop-related functionality has been removed:

### EditorCanvas Changes:
- Crop state variables removed (`_cropRect`, `_isCropMode`, etc.)
- `_activateCropMode()` and `_deactivateCropMode()` methods disabled
- Crop gesture handling disabled (returns early for crop tool)
- Crop drawing preview disabled
- Crop border rendering disabled
- Crop layer detection and clipping disabled
- `applyCrop()`, `cancelCrop()`, `hasPendingCrop` methods return early/false

### ScreenshotEditorScreen Changes:
- Crop control buttons removed from UI
- `_applyCrop()`, `_cancelCrop()`, `_hasPendingCrop` methods disabled
- Crop layer duplication logic disabled

### Models Preserved:
- `EditorTool.crop` enum value kept
- `LayerType.crop` enum value kept
- `CropLayer` class kept for future implementation
- All crop-related method signatures preserved for API compatibility

## Test Scenarios

1. **Tool Selection**: Crop tool can be selected from tool panel
2. **No Drawing**: Selecting crop tool and attempting to draw does nothing
3. **No Crop Controls**: No apply/cancel crop buttons appear
4. **No Crop Preview**: No crop overlay or border appears
5. **Other Tools Work**: All other tools continue to function normally

## Result
✅ **SUCCESS**: Crop tool button remains visible and selectable, but all crop functionality is disabled. Ready for fresh implementation from scratch.
