- **Alternative Commands**: Different approaches for different environments
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click command copying

**Example Commands**:
```bash
# Primary Command (Bash)
nmap -sV -sC {target_host}

# Alternative (PowerShell)
Test-NetConnection {target_host} -Port {port}

# Download Method (curl)
curl -o "tools/responder.py" "https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder"
```

**Variable Management**:
- Variables like `{target_host}` can be customized
- Context-aware substitution from previous steps
- Real-time command preview with substitutions

## 🧹 **Tab 3: Cleanup**

**Cleanup Categories**:
- **🟢 Low Priority**: Optional cleanup (cache files)
- **🟡 Medium Priority**: Recommended cleanup (temp files)
- **🔴 High Priority**: Important cleanup (user accounts)
- **🟣 Critical Priority**: Must-do cleanup (backdoors)

**Example Cleanup Steps**:
```bash
# Critical: Remove added user account
userdel -r testuser

# High: Clear command history
history -c && history -w

# Medium: Remove temporary files
rm -rf /tmp/scan_results/

# Low: Clear DNS cache
systemctl flush-dns
```

## ⚠️ **Tab 4: Issues & Troubleshooting**

**Issue Documentation**:
- **Symptom**: What you see when the issue occurs
- **Possible Causes**: Why this might be happening
- **Severity**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Multiple Resolutions**: Different approaches to fix

**Example Issue**:
```
Title: "Permission Denied on Port Scan"
Symptom: "nmap: Permission denied"
Causes:
  • Not running as root
  • Firewall blocking
  • Target blocking ICMP

Resolutions:
  1. Run with sudo: sudo nmap [options]
  2. Use TCP connect scan: nmap -sT [target]
  3. Use specific source port: nmap --source-port 53 [target]
```

## 🔍 **Tab 5: Findings**

**Finding Documentation**:
- **Title**: Clear finding name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation
- **Severity**: Informational → Critical
- **CVE ID**: If applicable
- **Affected Systems**: Which hosts/services

**Example Findings**:
```
Finding: "SMB Signing Disabled"
Severity: Medium
CVE: N/A
Description: SMB signing is not enforced, allowing potential relay attacks
Affected: DC01.corp.local, FILESERVER01.corp.local
```

**Integration**: Findings can be automatically captured and added to reports

## ✅ **Tab 6: Outcome Capture**

**Execution Status Tracking**:
- **🟢 Success**: Methodology completed successfully
- **🟡 Partial**: Some objectives achieved
- **🔴 Failed**: Methodology failed to execute
- **⚪ Skipped**: Intentionally bypassed
- **🟣 Blocked**: External factors prevented execution

**Captured Data**:
- Execution timestamp
- Output logs
- Error messages
- Execution duration
- Discovered assets
- Notes and observations

- **Contextual Step Cards**: Rich information before diving deep

### **Smart Command Generation**
```bash
# Before (static):
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

# After (dynamic with context):
nmap -sV {target_network} -oN scans/{target_name}_scan.txt
# Resolves to:
nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scans/CorpNet_scan.txt
```

### **Multi-Shell Support**
Choose the right tool for your environment:
- **🐧 Linux**: Bash commands with standard tools

## 🔄 **Workflow Example**

### **Scenario: NAC Bypass on Corporate Network**

1. **📖 Methodology Tab**:
   - Learn about NAC analysis techniques
   - Understand bypass strategies

2. **💻 Commands Tab**:
   ```bash
   # Analyze NAC behavior
   dhclient -v eth0

   # Alternative for Windows
   ipconfig /renew

   # Check quarantine VLAN
   ip route show | grep 192.168.100
   ```

3. **🧹 Cleanup Tab**:
   ```bash
   # Release DHCP lease
   dhclient -r eth0

   # Restore original MAC
   macchanger -p eth0
   ```

4. **⚠️ Issues Tab**:
   - "DHCP requests timeout" → Try different MAC address
   - "Still quarantined" → Analyze NAC agent requirements

5. **🔍 Findings Tab**:
   - Document: "NAC allows MAC address spoofing bypass"
   - Severity: High
   - Add affected network segments

6. **✅ Outcome Tab**:
   - Status: Success
   - Notes: "MAC spoofing successful after 3 attempts"
   - Assets: Added new VLAN access
