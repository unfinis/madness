## Implementation Strategy

### Current State Preservation
- ✅ Keep existing methodology viewer functionality
- ✅ Maintain JSON methodology templates
- ✅ Preserve asset management screens
- ✅ Continue using current UI patterns

### Migration Approach
1. **Parallel Development**: Build new features alongside existing ones
2. **Gradual Integration**: Phase in new storage and models
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain support for current JSON format
4. **Feature Flags**: Use flags to enable/disable new functionality

### Technical Decisions
- **Storage**: Migrate from JSON assets to Hive local database
- **State Management**: Continue with Riverpod (defer Bloc migration)
- **Models**: Add Freezed models while keeping existing classes
- **Security**: Implement in Phase 2 as planned

### Risk Mitigation
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to phased deliverables
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
- **Performance**: Monitor app performance during storage migration
- **User Experience**: Ensure smooth transition between phases
